## Code exercise using pytest and pyscript

This is an example of using [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/) to create an autograded python assignment entirely in the browser. Some highlights:

1. uses standard pytest tests
2. reloads the answers before running tests
3. less than 50 lines of code (excluding tests and HTML/CSS)
